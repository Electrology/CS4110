" My favorite color is lime green. My favorite recipe is chicken pesto pasta. The ingredients are 1 tablespoon canola oil, 2 chicken breasts sliced into .5 inch strips, 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic, .5 tablespoons of kosher salt and black pepper, 3/4 cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of shaved parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of pesto, 3 cups of penne, 3/4 cups of halved cherry tomatoes, and basil/parmesan to garnish. To make, first heat oil in pan over high heat. Combine the chicken, garlic, salt, and pepper, cook until chicken is browned. Then, mix in the heavy cream, parmesan, and pesto, stirring until evenly combined. Next, bring to a boil and cook until the sauce has reduced, about five to seven minutes. Toss in the pasta and cherry tomatoes, stirring until evenly coated. Remove from heat. Garnish with basil and parmesan cheese and serve. "
